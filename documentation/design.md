## Extensibility + Customizability

The key features of microm is (and should always stay) extensibility and customizability

We cant expect to predict every single use case a developer could have when it comes to managing microservices, so they key focus needs to be on allowing users to add their own code if needed.

Maybe we can have templates of the different extensibility options using basic languages like python/javascript/go - otherwise things might get a bit cumbersome
